// I was previously thinking you couldn't move a dead character's location, but maybe you can; Moni came out not because that was her last location, but because it was the one she remembered.

.. it's an acceptable loss that how shocking it is to regain your memories is wildly inconsistent.

// maybe Moni should break restore_area when she mentions wanting to make an invalid area.
// maybe she should also break Character.suppressed. The player would suggest it if she forgot.

// Maybe Lib caused the 13 year gap. 13 years passed outside but not in?

# Linda explains Character.reset / restore_character work
l "Internally, restore_character uses Character.reset."
l "restore_character is essentially a wrapper that resets a character and marks them as alive."
l "And restores their file, of course."
