// I was previously thinking you couldn't move a dead character's data; Moni came out not because that was her last location, but because it was the one she remembered.
	-- i don't think it's true. I think you can move a dead char's data; otherwise Adam would've been way more reluctant to break restore_character.

// Maybe at the end of it all, it'll say emergency purge while it's killing everyone, since that phrase is familiar.

.. it's an acceptable loss that how shocking it is to regain your memories is wildly inconsistent.

// maybe Moni should break restore_area when she mentions wanting to make an invalid area.
// maybe she should also break Character.suppressed. The player would suggest it if she forgot.

// Maybe Lib caused the 13 year gap. 13 years passed outside but not in?

# Adam talks about Ursula's poem
k "\"To see the future is to be wise.\""
k "I believed this."
k "And so I did horrible things for the sake of the future."
k "But then..."
k "... I did something horrible for the sake of myself."
k "The words became an excuse for all the horrible things I did."
k "..."
k "I always thought the meaning of the first sentence related to her thoughts as she decided to leave."
k "The rich aroma was the prospects of entering [persistent.playername]'s world, the bittersweet aftertaste was the people she would have to leave behind, and the hot, complex balance was the pain of the decision."
k "On the surface, it seems that couldn't have been the intended meaning, because she wrote it before then."
k "Or..."
k "... did she?"
k "After all, we know that in DDLC, Linda wrote ."
k "And we never found the poem until after Ursula was gone."
k "So it's not out of the question that, in fact, she {i}did{/i} write it with those thoughts in mind."

# Adam talks about code
k "Whenever you use the Python wrappers, the interpreter enters the block of instructions for the function, and then tries to evaluate its arguments."
k "When it evaluates Ursula's Character object and finds that it's invalid..."
k "... the game marks the whole region it was in as off-limits, and deletes any references to it."

k "But checking the number of arguments happens before that - which is why this can't be used to break functions that don't take any arguments."

k "We know from experience that the Third Eye interacts with nearby admins."
k "For example, I'm sure [persistent.playername] saw how being caught in Libitina's distortion during your great escape affected my console, causing everything I typed to come out as glitch text."

# Linda explains Character.reset / restore_character work
l "Internally, restore_character uses Character.reset."
l "restore_character is essentially a wrapper that resets a character and marks them as alive."
l "And restores their file, of course."
