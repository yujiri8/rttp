// I was previously thinking you couldn't move a dead character's location, but maybe you can; Moni came out not because that was her last location, but because it was the one she remembered.

// maybe Moni should break restore_area when she mentions wanting to make an invalid area.
// maybe she should also break Character.suppressed. The player would suggest it if she forgot.

// Maybe Lib caused the 13 year gap. 13 years passed outside but not in?

# Linda explains Character.reset / restore_character work
l "Internally, restore_character uses Character.reset."
l "restore_character is essentially a wrapper that resets a character and marks them as alive."
l "And restores their file, of course."
