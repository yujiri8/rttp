Also, obviously, the license only applies to stuff I made. Other people's assets may not be under the same terms (and original DDLC content is under [these terms](http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/)), but I've made sure I have permission to use them.

The file 'SCRAPS' contains a couple of less important thoughts (that I don't need input on) and bunch of disorganized scraps of dialog that might end up being used.

# Big things that still need doing

* There is a way to make a character admin without using VR, but Adam broke that API once he realized it would let them win easy. Dialog on this is in SCRAPS. It needs to be inserted somewhere. Since a broken API is the same as nonexistent one, when they realize it and try different possibilities, they'll conclude not that it's broken but that they can't figure out what it's called. He'll reveal the truth some time in chapter26/chapter27.

	If I insert it in chapter24, it seems to not play well with the drama of what Monika has to do (since she'd still have to do it either way since they aren't sure Adam will try to get Libitina out for them), and in chapter25 it doesn't seem like there's a space for it in the strict schedule of other things that have to happen once Libitina and Monika come back.

* The kiss may be a solvable problem now. I contrived Renier's arrival to stop this in part 1 because I couldn't write it even if I wanted to, but now that MC isn't always POV, it's possible he and his favorite girl could do it at some point in part 3 where it could be offscreen or something. I would love to not do it at all, but with them having wanted to since DDLC, it's entirely implausible that they never get around to it after all this.

* Chapter 26 is marked with a couple of TODOs where I feel it might be necessary to insert dialogue where they consider / cross out some of the possibilities I'm not running with.

# Plans for the ending

* Adam's survival depends on whether you've picked the mercy-favoring options. If so he escapes with them into the real world. Otherwise Libitina destroys him.

* I want to make it so Libitina will also die unless the player correctly remembers the name and syntax of some admin command. How to make this happen exactly I'll have to figure out.

# Other, smaller things

* Should I edit chapter22 so Adam actually tries to wipe Natsuki's memories at the rift, but it doesn't work? I feel it's a bit iffy that he just offhandly reveals that memory wipe doesn't work on prepared characters without the player seeing it fail.

# Images

* Improve Amy/Michael sprites (Amy should be taller, Michael may need expression improvement) - I can do this myself

* Ideally a better warehouse interior than the Uncle Mugen temple-like drawing I'm currently using. Probably also get a rifted version of it, if not one of the city.

* Logo? I'm still using the DDMC logo. It would be great if I had a logo of the Portrait of Markov book with the eye symbol on it. Maybe I could draw it.

Also, if you notice any assets I'm currently using that aren't in credits, let me know.

# Accepted plotholes

I've given up on solving these.

* Adam says he didn't want to make Libitina admin way back when, but given he obviously knew about both memory wiping and API breaking, why didn't he wipe her memories, break memory restoring, and then give her the power and she wouldn't know what he'd done to her? I'm pretty much resigned to leaving this as a plothole, but I'd very much appreciate any workable solution.

* Given the effective reality of the Portrait of Markov world, isn't staying there better than escaping, given they could be immortal (but retain the option to eventually leave) as well as pseudo-omnipotent? Adam's explanation of how the world is unsafe is pretty unconvincing, clearly motivated reasoning. I don't think there can be a satisfying answer to this and I'm not too upset about leaving it, but let me know if you have any good ideas.
