The file `SCRAPS` contains a couple of thoughts and scraps of dialog that didn't make it in.

# Accepted plotholes

I've given up on solving these.

* Adam says he didn't want to make Libitina admin way back when, but given he obviously knew about both memory wiping and API breaking, why didn't he wipe her memories, break memory restoring, and then give her the power and she wouldn't know what he'd done to her? I'm pretty much resigned to leaving this as a plothole, but I'd very much appreciate any workable solution.

* Given the effective reality of the Portrait of Markov world, isn't staying there better than escaping, given they could be immortal (but retain the option to eventually leave) as well as pseudo-omnipotent? Adam's explanation of how the world is unsafe is pretty unconvincing, clearly motivated reasoning. I don't think there can be a satisfying answer to this and I'm not too upset about leaving it, but let me know if you have any good ideas.

* MC doesn't get a character file even when he's not POV. This wouldn't be too difficult to fix, but honestly, I didn't notice it until the night of the release, and by then, I so hated the thought of this project not being done that I chose to leave it in.
