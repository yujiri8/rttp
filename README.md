Description of the mod and installation instructions [here](https://yujiri.xyz/works/return_to_the_portrait/).

Also, obviously, the license only applies to stuff I made. Other people's assets may not be under the same terms (and original DDLC content is under [these terms](https://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/)), but I've made sure I have permission to use them.

The file 'SCRAPS' contains a couple of less important thoughts (that I don't need input on) and bunch of disorganized scraps of dialog that might end up being used.

# Other, smaller things

* Should I edit chapter22 so Adam actually tries to wipe Natsuki's memories at the rift, but it doesn't work? I feel it's a bit iffy that he just offhandly reveals that memory wipe doesn't work on prepared characters without the player seeing it fail.

# Images

* Logo? I'm still using the DDMC logo. It would be great if I had a logo of the Portrait of Markov book with the eye symbol on it. Maybe I could draw it.

Also, if you notice any assets I'm currently using that aren't in credits, let me know.

# Accepted plotholes

I've given up on solving these.

* Adam says he didn't want to make Libitina admin way back when, but given he obviously knew about both memory wiping and API breaking, why didn't he wipe her memories, break memory restoring, and then give her the power and she wouldn't know what he'd done to her? I'm pretty much resigned to leaving this as a plothole, but I'd very much appreciate any workable solution.

* Given the effective reality of the Portrait of Markov world, isn't staying there better than escaping, given they could be immortal (but retain the option to eventually leave) as well as pseudo-omnipotent? Adam's explanation of how the world is unsafe is pretty unconvincing, clearly motivated reasoning. I don't think there can be a satisfying answer to this and I'm not too upset about leaving it, but let me know if you have any good ideas.
