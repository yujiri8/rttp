The file 'SCRAPS' contains a couple of less important thoughts (that I don't need input on) and bunch of disorganized scraps of dialog that might end up being used.

# Big things that still need doing

* There is a way to make a character admin without using VR, but Adam broke that API once he realized it would let them win easy. Dialog on this is in SCRAPS. It needs to be inserted somewhere. Since a broken API is the same as nonexistent one, when they realize it and try different possibilities, they'll conclude not that it's broken but that they can't figure out what it's called. He'll reveal the truth some time in chapter26/chapter27.

	If I insert it in chapter24, it seems to not play well with the drama of what Monika has to do (since she'd still have to do it either way since they aren't sure Adam will try to get Libitina out for them), and in chapter25 it doesn't seem like there's a space for it in the strict schedule of other things that have to happen once Libitina and Monika come back.

* The kiss may be a solvable problem now. I contrived Renier's arrival to stop this in part 1 because I couldn't write it even if I wanted to, but now that MC isn't always POV, it's possible he and his favorite girl could do it at some point in part 3 where it could be offscreen or something. I would love to not do it at all, but with them having wanted to since DDLC, it's entirely implausible that they never get around to it after all this.

* Chapter 26 is marked with a couple of TODOs where I feel it might be necessary to insert dialogue where they consider / cross out some of the possibilities I'm not running with.

* I need to decide what to do about the unfinished branch where Natsuki punches Libitina if Libitina shot her. I shouldn't make that happen. It's a pretty damning portrayal of Natsuki when I think about it.

# Outline for the ending

* They escape the danger zone, and use DDLC to heal Libitina and Adam. A lot of talk. Adam's going to help.

* They decide to do their thing: make Libitina admin to get out. Adam uses the DDLC escape trick to make Libitina admin.

* They do their plan: open Libitina's Eye and then stop her after she opens the portal.

	They'll have her open the portal and then try to stop her from going through it (since they know that closes it). They might theorize the portal only closes if someone with an open Third Eye goes through it. They'll succeed in stopping her by using everyone else's Third Eye, but they'll break the world so much that everything else is destroyed, including the whole population except for them, and they can't undo it. Finally, they'll leave.

	* Maybe it's opening the portal on top of a rift that breaks everything irreversibly.

* Adam's survival depends on whether you've picked the mercy-favoring options. If so he escapes with them into the real world. Otherwise Libitina destroys him.

* I want to make it so Libitina will also die unless the player correctly remembers the name and syntax of some admin command. How to make this happen exactly I'll have to figure out.

# Other, smaller things

* Should I edit chapter22 so Adam actually tries to wipe Natsuki's memories at the rift, but it doesn't work? I feel it's a bit iffy that he just offhandly reveals that memory wipe doesn't work on prepared characters without the player seeing it fail.

* I still haven't really nailed down in canon what makes the Third Eye grow if anything. I'm thinking that it grows from having one's mind essentially destroyed by traumatization like they all were at the facility. It might have a limit. I plan to have Adam exposit on this in chapter27 or so, or maybe Renier and Linda in chapter24.

* A thing I've decided on that I haven't said anywhere is that probably, the Third Eye is a naturally occurring thing in the Portrait of Markov even before Ursula's escape, but it's dormant until some contact with medium-awareness. Contact with an admin character seems to count. (If I don't explain this, it doesn't make sense that it was never discovered before Ursula's awakening and escape.)

# Images needed

* Improve Amy/Michael sprites (Amy should be taller, Michael may need expression improvement) - I can do this myself

* Ideally a better warehouse interior than the Uncle Mugen temple-like drawing I'm currently using. Probably also get a rifted version of it, if not one of the city.

* Logo? I'm still using the DDMC logo. It would be great if I had a logo of the Portrait of Markov book with the eye symbol on it. Maybe I could draw it.

Also, if you notice any assets I'm currently using that aren't in credits, let me know.

# Accepted plotholes

I've given up on solving these.

* Adam says he didn't want to make Libitina admin way back when, but given he obviously knew about both memory wiping and API breaking, why didn't he wipe her memories, break memory restoring, and then give her the power and she wouldn't know what he'd done to her? I'm pretty much resigned to leaving this as a plothole, but I'd very much appreciate any workable solution.

* Given the effective reality of the Portrait of Markov world, isn't staying there better than escaping, given they could be immortal (but retain the option to eventually leave) as well as pseudo-omnipotent? Adam's explanation of how the world is unsafe is pretty unconvincing, clearly motivated reasoning. I don't think there can be a satisfying answer to this and I'm not too upset about leaving it, but let me know if you have any good ideas.
